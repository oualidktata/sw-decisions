Mini-Era for Mobile
[x] Work directly against our repos, no vendor intermediary repos

# I- Identify the best CI/CD approach for mobile apps:

Identify the best workflow approach: trunk-based vs feature-based workflow
Code review in Trunk-based & FF context for (web,mobile,back-end (microservices))

## Use Feature flags

[x] P1: Firebase.RemoteConfig
[] P2: Silent push notification: update config (hack)
[] P2.1: Connector Zapier()

## Code review process

## Testing approach: using appcenter

# II-Identify quality standard to be enforced in code reviews

### For usability

### For maintainability

### For readability

### For testability

### For responsiveness

### Etc.

# III-Identify common practices for all apps

## Requirement: common framework for capturing requirements (BDD=acceptance testing).

## Architecture: common architecture (including, BFF, state management, secret management, AuthN, AuthZ)

## Development: Methodology (user Story(Feature)-Cycle: req using BDD and notation-> Identify screens-> dev with TDD-> Acceptance)â€¦.

## Testing (approaches, tools, good practices, etc.):

### Behavior Driven development (BDD+ specification by example with gherkins tool : cucumber) Web/mobile

### Unit tests : write good unit tests, framework (JEST), approach (TDD),

### Integration Testing: CDC (using Pact.io), acceptance testing

### E2E: cypress

### UI storybook/ mobile

# IV- Identify a common set of libraries for all projects

## Security (reactive-native-xyz,chart,)

## UI/UX

## HTTP

# V Misc

## DCTU: unit tests not properly done.

## Leverage best practices
