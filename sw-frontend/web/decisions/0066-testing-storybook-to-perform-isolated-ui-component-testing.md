# 66. testing-storybook to perform Isolated UI component testing

Date: 2022-01-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context


## Decision

We will use storybooks to test all shared UI components.

## Consequences

Using storybooks and CDD will allow us to create UI components that are more **robust** and more **reusable** since edge cases are identified early in the development process.
We allow us to have increased levels of confidence on the UI components shared between projects.
