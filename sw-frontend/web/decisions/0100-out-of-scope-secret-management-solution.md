# 101. Fine-grained authorization using OPA

Date: 2022-06-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source general-purpose policy engine, licensed under the Apache License 2.0, that allows you to decouple policy decision-making from application code. OPA assists organizations in effectively implementing policy as code. It allows policy to be expressed through a high-level declarative language (Rego), and it also allows policy authoring to be decentralized and distributed to policy owners. By codifying policy, organizations can create context-aware policies that adapt to changes in the environment or in data, allowing for advanced automation.
