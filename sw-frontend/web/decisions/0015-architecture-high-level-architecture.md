## Context

After setting up the **workspace**, it's time for the architecture. We need to define the layers, the components and all the relationships. We need to define the principles and standards that will be enforced by the architecture so that developers understand the rationale behind each decision in order to not deviate from the agreed upon vision.

## Decision
- Adhere to all individual decisions identified in this topic (ADR-0006 to ADR-0014). The supporting documentation provides all the details on how to implement them and the rationale behind every decision.

- Adhere to the angular guiding style for naming conventions[1].
- follow our variation of naming conventions as described in the high-level architecture documentation[2].

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
