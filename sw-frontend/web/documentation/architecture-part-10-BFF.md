# BFF (own subject)
The BFF or Back-end for the front-end deals with cross-cutting concerns of the front-end whether it's a regular FE app or a MFE. It aggregates data from the back-end services to serve the specific needs of the front-end. It caches data for the whole application or MFE.

Performance:
1-Reduce client 'chattiness' by creating 'view-specific'APIs.
2-Parallelism & Asynchronous Operations
