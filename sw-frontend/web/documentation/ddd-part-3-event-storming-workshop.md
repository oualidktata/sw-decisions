**Big Picture**
This is the best format to explore complexity in an intricate domain. You’d like to involve all the different perspectives in the workshop, that will progressively build structure upon a chaotic structure. Variations on this theme allow to handle scenarios like enterprise reboot (gathering understanding and consensus around a new organisational vision); critical project kick-off (exploring the scope and the surroundings of a new enterprise software project) or organisation retrospective (beyond the boundaries of a  typical team retro).
The actual outcomes usually go beyond the official promise: collective learning is the first outcome (usually with no negative  ide-effects), but the achieved clarity usually triggers interesting reactions.
**Process Modelling**
This is tailored around the needs of designing processes and services as a synthesis of different disciplines and perspectives, like business (focusing on value delivery, but also managing costs and revenues), user experience (focusing on the needs and feelings of users and internal stakeholders) and software development (focusing on the responsibility boundaries and implementation constraints).
A sophisticated language is created step by step injecting precision in the discussion. No hand-off will be necessary: different tribes are already in.
**Software Design**
Domain Events allow the discussion to get fine grained, exploring the forces behind a given software structure. Independent software components emerge around the need for consistent behaviour. Outcomes of complex processes map very well with end-to-end testing strategies such as BDD.
The divergent attitudes of the modelling team will require a specific discipline in leading the discussion: branching, drilling and the tendency to solve everything are powerful forces that need to be tamed in order to deliver successful results.

## Events
Events are the glue that make the magic possible.
- They’re building blocks of consistent storytelling, and this will allow your team to double check the emerging narrative.
- They’re semantically robust, a fact that happened at a given moment in time carrying less ambiguity than a process or a phase.
- They’re fine grained. Once we get rid of spatial limitations, we can see the forest and the trees. Turns out it’s often just a matter of space.
- They trigger human reactions. Getting deep into details we implicitly trigger emotional responses from participants, challenging the fallacies of the current narrative.
- They trigger system reactions. Policies are organisation’s behavior made explicit. And they’re hooked onto given events.
- They allow precise software modelling. The DDD community struggled around the concept of Ubiquitous Language, mostly looking for nouns, we now know that Events are a way better building block for such a language.
- They allow for more efficient software architectures. Software monoliths are not a good choice for the long term, loosely coupled bounded contexts propagating information like domain events are a much more resilient choice.
