## What can go wrong?

## What's a grid?
- Using a grid when a table is needed, or vice versa
- Semantics and keyboard navigation
- Small viewports, zoom, and other visual accessibility issues
- Sorting and filtering
- Row selection
- Virtualization (i.e. loading rows on demand in a very large grid or table)
## What's a table?
The important thing is that if a design decision is made to structure information as a table to surface column and row relationships, then it needs to be semantically marked up as a table to provide that same experience to screen reader users.

So, in essence: a table is a method of displaying information to enable the easy consumption of two-dimensional relationships within that information.
