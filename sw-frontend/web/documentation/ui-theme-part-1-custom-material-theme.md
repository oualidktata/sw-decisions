# Goals
Developers should not worry about:
- Global styling or local styling of components. No need to be a pro of CSS.
- Learning Rotor design principles to create new components since the Core UI team already provided a theme that solved those concerns for all teams.
Developers should :
- Only focus on using the right material component or composite component for the user story in hand.
- Use the right **snippet** to use html code for UI components to integrate in their pages.

# What to deliver
- A custom angular material theme created based on our Rotor design and the well established Angular material UI library.
